## 1. P0 — pre-implementation validation (macOS PoC)

A throwaway macOS validation spike to de-risk the in-app authentication direction **before** the
rewrite. It runs on a real Mac with Touch ID. **The goal is the highest practical fidelity to the
real production path, not the smallest diff.** On the dedicated throwaway branch the spike *may*
touch production, red-line, and project files when that makes the validation closer to the real
path — chasing a minimal diff would make the test unrealistic and seriously reduce its value. None
of the PoC code merges to `main`; only the findings and the resulting doc updates are carried back.
Acceptance items:

1. **No resign.** An inline `LAAuthenticationView` driving `evaluateAccessControl` /
   `evaluatePolicy` does **not** post `NSApplication.didResignActiveNotification` (and
   `NSApplication.shared.isActive` stays `true`) for the full prompt lifecycle. (If this fails,
   the macOS "Immediately" model must be revisited.)
2. **Per-operation context consumption — software path.** A context authenticated via
   `evaluateAccessControl(accessControl, operation:, …)` satisfies
   `SecureEnclave.P256.KeyAgreement.PrivateKey(dataRepresentation:, authenticationContext: ctx)`
   with **no second prompt**, for the app's exact wrapping access-control flags
   (`.biometryAny` and, in Standard mode, `.or .devicePasscode`) and the correct
   `LAAccessControlOperation`. Confirm the reconstruct + unwrap then succeed.
3. **Per-operation context consumption — custody path.** The same context drives a custody
   `SecKey` operation (`SecKeyCreateSignature` / `SecKeyCopyKeyExchangeResult`) loaded with
   `kSecUseAuthenticationContext: ctx`, no second prompt.
   **Deferred (PoC):** Secure Enclave custody is not yet productized, so this item is not validated
   by the narrow per-operation harness. A meaningful custody-auth validation likely needs a more
   product-shaped custody flow combined with the in-window authentication model; the harness spike
   was attempted and discontinued (the on-device run was an invalid experiment, not a custody
   feasibility result — see [POC findings](AUTH_LIFECYCLE_REDESIGN_POC_FINDINGS.md)). Revisit when
   custody is product-shaped; the definition above remains the target for that future attempt.
4. **Unlock auth is not reused for key use.** Confirm the authentication that unlocked the app
   does **not** silently authorize a later private-key operation (signing, decryption,
   certification, revocation, or a key-expiry change) — that operation triggers its own
   authentication. (Unsigned standalone encryption — recipient-key or password-protected — does not use the private-key
   operation router, Secure Enclave, or private-key authentication; an encrypt-and-sign operation
   authenticates for its signing step — see DESIGN §7.) This validates the narrow separation in DESIGN
   §2 (principle 5); it is **not** a test that every operation must re-authenticate, and a single
   user action spanning several keys (auth-mode switch / re-wrap) still authenticates once.
5. **In-app password fallback — feasibility decision.** Determine whether a safe in-app password /
   login-password path exists through public APIs (credential verification without weakening the
   model or logging secrets). **Decision rule (pre-approved):** if it is not safely achievable,
   drop the Standard-mode password fallback on macOS for this flow and require biometrics on macOS
   (and update SECURITY.md §4). Either outcome unblocks P4/P5.
6. **Mode-switch / rewrap under the presenter.** Validate that the `AuthenticationManager` re-wrap
   flow authenticates **once for the whole action** when presented in-app on macOS — a single
   in-window prompt for the switch even though it re-wraps every key (exactly as today) — with no
   resign and the SECURITY.md §4 atomicity / crash-recovery semantics preserved.
7. **visionOS — deferred (no hardware).** visionOS follows the iOS direction by decision; on-device
   Optic-ID + `ScenePhase` confirmation is deferred until hardware is available and tracked as an
   unvalidated assumption, not a design fork.

PoC findings are recorded back into this document and the design before P1 begins.

## 2. Phasing (each phase is its own PR)

- **P0 — Validation PoC** (above). Throwaway branch only: it may touch production / red-line /
  project files for fidelity (§1), but none of its code merges to `main` — only findings/docs
  carry back.
- **P1 — macOS single window.** Remove the standalone `Settings { }` scene; route macOS settings
  into the main window. Independent of the auth rework; ships first to simplify the surface. (§3.4)
- **P2 — `AppLockController` + stop reacting to `.active`.** Introduce the explicit lock state
  machine and the per-platform away-event rule; decouple operation prompts from lock; keep the
  current lock UI temporarily (derived from the new state); extend tracing to the new states.
  This is the core behavioral fix.
- **P3 — Decoupled cosmetic cover.** Extract the cover into its own modifier keyed only to scene
  activity; remove the cosmetic responsibility from the lock overlay. Cover trigger is **decided:
  `.inactive`** for now (a later move to `.background`-only on iOS is an optional refinement).
- **P4 — macOS in-app auth surfaces.** Embedded unlock screen + in-app password fallback;
  explanatory pages for App Access change & mode switch; introduce `AuthenticationPresenting`.
- **P5 — macOS in-app per-operation auth.** Route per-op auth through the presenter using
  `evaluateAccessControl` + `authenticationContext` / `kSecUseAuthenticationContext`.
- **P6 — iOS / iPadOS / visionOS custom lock screen + auto-invoke.**
- **P7 — Delete dead machinery.** Remove `PrivacyScreenLifecycleGate`, the union-snapshot
  plumbing, and the `AuthenticationShield*` dismissal machinery once unused; keep a lock-state
  trace; complete on-device custody verification.

Order and grouping are negotiable; phases may merge or split. P2 must keep the current
grace=0 protection working until P3–P7 supersede it (no interim regression window).

## 3. Current → target component map

### 3.1 Lock / lifecycle
- `Sources/Security/ProtectedData/AppSessionOrchestrator.swift` (red line) — its resume / grace /
  blur / settle responsibilities move into the new `AppLockController`; the orchestrator either
  becomes that controller or a thin adapter. Its `handleResumeForLifecycle` `.active`-driven
  re-evaluation is replaced by away-event-driven transitions.
- `Sources/App/Common/PrivacyScreenModifier.swift` — splits into (a) a dumb cosmetic-cover
  modifier and (b) thin lifecycle wiring that feeds away events to `AppLockController`. The
  iOS `.onChange(of: scenePhase)` and macOS `NSApplication` observers stay but stop consulting a gate.
- `Sources/App/Common/PrivacyScreenLifecycleGate.swift` — **deleted** in P7 (its sole job, the
  `.active` disambiguation, no longer exists).
- `Sources/Security/AuthenticationPromptCoordinator.swift` — the union-snapshot plumbing added
  for the grace=0 fix is removed in P7; any remaining operation-progress signal is presentational only.
- `Sources/App/Common/AuthenticationShield*` (`AuthenticationShieldCoordinator`,
  `AuthenticationShieldHost`, `AuthenticationShieldOverlayView`) — superseded by the in-app
  auth surfaces (macOS) and the lock screen; removed/slimmed in P7.

### 3.2 macOS in-app authentication (new)
- New `AuthenticationPresenting` protocol + a macOS implementation hosting `LAAuthenticationView`
  (or `LARight.authorize(in:)`), plus iOS/visionOS pass-through.
- New in-app lock screen views (macOS embedded; iOS/visionOS custom) and explanatory-page views
  for App Access change & mode switch.
- `Sources/Security/AuthenticationManager.swift` (red line) — `evaluateAppSession` and the
  mode-switch flow adopt the presenter on macOS; `LAPolicy` selection unchanged.

### 3.3 Private-key operation auth (new wiring)
- `Sources/Services/KeyManagement/PrivateKeyAccessService.swift` and the custody bridges
  (`PGPExternalP256SigningProviderBridge`, `PGPExternalP256KeyAgreementProviderBridge`) accept a
  pre-authenticated `LAContext` from the presenter; software path passes it to the CryptoKit SE
  key init (`authenticationContext:`), custody path via `kSecUseAuthenticationContext`.
- `Sources/Security/SecureEnclaveManager.swift` (red line) — `reconstructKey` gains an
  optional authenticated `LAContext`.

### 3.4 macOS single-window
- `Sources/App/CypherAirApp.swift` — remove the `Settings { }` scene (≈ lines 342–377) and its
  second `authenticationShieldHost(handlesLifecycleEvents:false)`; preserve Cmd-, via
  `CommandGroup(replacing: .appSettings)` that routes to the in-main-window settings.
- `Sources/App/Settings/MacSettingsRootView.swift`, `Sources/App/Settings/ProtectedSettingsHost.swift`
  — drop `MacPresentationHostMode.settingsScene` / `.settingsSceneProxy` and the
  `openMainWindowAction` proxy; always `.mainWindow` / `.mainWindowLive` (reuse
  `MainWindowSettingsRootView`).
- Remove/repurpose the `UITEST_ROOT="settings"` launch path.

## 4. Test strategy

- **`AppLockController` unit tests** — the lock machine is pure and fully unit-testable (no
  lifecycle timing): genuine away → lock; biometric `.inactive`/`.active` → no lock; within /
  over interval; macOS screen-lock / explicit; "Immediately" semantics per platform. This
  replaces the fragile gate-timing tests and the on-device-trace dependence.
- **Cosmetic cover tests** — cover shown iff not active; no auth side effects.
- **macOS UI tests** — update the six `launchSettings()` tests in `UITests/MacUISmokeTests.swift`
  to `launchMain() + openSettingsTab()`; add in-app-unlock and explanatory-page coverage.
- **Device biometric tests** (`CypherAir-DeviceTests`) — in-app unlock; per-operation inline
  auth (single prompt, no resign, content preserved); custody route verification.
- **Auth-trace assertions** — lock-state transitions and away/lock triggers, captured via
  `CYPHERAIR_DEBUG_AUTH_TRACE` during P2–P6.
- **visionOS** — build probe (no test plan); manual Optic-ID validation.
- Per [TESTING.md](TESTING.md): `cargo +stable test` (no Rust change expected), the
  `CypherAir-UnitTests` and `CypherAir-MacUITests` plans, and the visionOS build probe each phase.

## 5. Risks & red lines

- **Red-line review.** `AppSessionOrchestrator`, `Sources/Security/ProtectedData/*`,
  `AuthenticationManager`, `SecureEnclaveManager`, and entitlements require human security review
  per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) §10. Each touching phase carries positive + negative + round-trip tests.
- **No interim regression.** The merged grace=0 fix must keep working until superseded; P2 lands
  the new model behind the same observable behavior before P7 removes the old machinery.
- **macOS PoC dependency.** P4/P5 depend on the P0 "no-resign" and "per-op context consumption"
  results. If "no-resign" fails, revisit the macOS away-event model before building P4/P5.
- **macOS Standard-mode fallback (decided, conditional).** Preferred is a safe in-app password
  field; if P0 shows that is not achievable through public APIs, the **pre-approved** outcome is to
  remove the Standard-mode password fallback on macOS for this flow (biometrics required on macOS)
  and update SECURITY.md §4. iOS / iPadOS / visionOS keep the system passcode fallback. Any in-app
  password field must validate credentials safely (no secret logging; correct failure mapping).
- **Security posture unchanged.** The app-unlock authentication is never reused to authorize a
  private-key operation, and private-key operations authenticate on their own (DESIGN §2,
  principle 5); relock fail-closed; Phase 1/2 boundary intact. (This is the narrow
  unlock-vs-key-use rule, not a blanket per-operation re-authentication mandate.)

## 6. SE-custody prompt — tracking

Verified (grep, 2026-06-05): operation/custody services have **no** direct references to
`AppSessionOrchestrator` / `requestContentClear` / relock / blur. The only coupling to lock is
`withOperationPrompt` → the coordinator snapshot, read **only** by `PrivacyScreenModifier`
(feeding the gate) and the orchestrator resume guards — i.e. the `.active`-evaluation path.

Consequences for tracking (do not drop):
- Once lock stops reacting to `.active` (P2), no path remains for a custody/operation biometric
  to trigger lock / content-clear / re-prompt — the original custody duplicate-auth gap is closed
  for the lock concern.
- **Transitional ordering:** this holds only after P2; custody stays production-blocked
  (`PGPKeyCapabilityResolver.production`) throughout, so there is no user-facing exposure, but
  the ordering is tracked.
- **On-device verification** (P7): custody signing/key-agreement under the new model performs a
  single in-app prompt with no content clear / relock.
- The already-shipped off-main custody hop stays (responsiveness; independent of this work).

## 7. Decisions & remaining validation items

Folding in the reviewer's direction (2026-06-05).

**Decided (folded into the design):**
1. **macOS embedded mechanism.** `LAAuthenticationView` + `LAContext` (`evaluateAccessControl` /
   `evaluatePolicy`) is the primary direction and the one to validate first — it stays on the
   `LAContext` path used today and only changes the macOS presentation. `LARight.authorize(in:)` is
   a secondary fallback, used only if the primary cannot meet a need.
2. **macOS auto-lock interval.** Reuse the existing grace setting as the unified auto-lock interval
   for now. A separate macOS-specific setting is an optional future study, out of scope here.
3. **iOS cover trigger.** `.inactive` for now (snapshot-safe; accepts a brief cosmetic flash behind
   a biometric sheet). A later move to `.background`-only is an optional refinement.
4. **visionOS.** Follow the iOS direction. On-device validation is deferred (no visionOS hardware);
   iOS-equivalent behavior is tracked as an unvalidated assumption, not a design fork.
5. **Password fallback (conditional, pre-approved).** Prefer a safe in-app password field; if P0
   shows it is not achievable through public APIs, remove the Standard-mode password fallback on
   macOS for this flow (biometrics required on macOS) and update SECURITY.md §4.

**Remaining validation items (P0 / technical validation):**
1. **In-app password-field feasibility** — whether a safe public-API credential path exists; drives
   decision (5) above. (P0 item 5)
2. **Mode-switch / rewrap under the presenter** — the `AuthenticationManager` re-wrap flow's single
   in-app authentication for the whole switch on macOS (one prompt even though it re-wraps every key,
   exactly as today), with atomicity + crash recovery preserved. (P0 item 6)
3. **visionOS on-device behavior** — Optic-ID + `ScenePhase`, confirmed when hardware is available.
   (P0 item 7)

## 8. Other macOS auth call sites still on the system sheet (to migrate or explicitly handle)

Beyond the per-operation **unwrap** path wired in §3.3, several macOS flows still trigger the **old
detached/system LocalAuthentication sheet** today and are **not** named in the P0 items or the
§3.2/§3.3 presenter wiring. They are tracked here so a later phase (P4/P5, or a follow-up) either
migrates them to the in-window presenter or makes a deliberate decision to leave them on the system
sheet. **None is fixed or validated now** (read-only sweep, 2026-06-06).

The Secure-Enclave auth model has **two distinct choke points**; the redesign so far names only the
first:
- **Operation / unwrap** — `PrivateKeyAccessService.unwrapPrivateKey` →
  `SecureEnclaveManager.reconstructKey(…authenticationContext:)`. Covered by §3.3.
- **Provisioning / wrap** — `SecureEnclaveManager.generateWrappingKey(accessControl:authenticationContext:)`
  + `wrap(…)`. The wrap-time self-ECDH (`sharedSecretFromKeyAgreement`) triggers Face ID unless a
  pre-authenticated `LAContext` is threaded in. The `generateWrappingKey` source comment states the
  context is passed precisely so the wrap self-ECDH does not "trigger Face ID again";
  `PrivateKeyRewrapWorkflow` passes it (rewrap → no prompt), but **initial generation and import pass
  `nil`** (`KeyProvisioningService`), so they prompt. This provisioning choke point is **not** named
  in §3.2/§3.3.

| Path | macOS prompt today | Origin (choke point) | Plan coverage | Action later |
|------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Key generation / provisioning** | Detached sheet | wrap-time self-ECDH; `KeyProvisioningService.generateKey` (nil context) | **Not covered** | Authenticate in-window first, then thread the context into `generateWrappingKey(authenticationContext:)` — the pattern `PrivateKeyRewrapWorkflow` already uses for rewrap. |
| **Key import / restore** | Detached sheet | same wrap-time self-ECDH; `KeyProvisioningService.importKey` (nil context) | **Not covered** | Same as generation. |
| **Key export / backup** | Detached sheet | unwrap path; `KeyExportService` → `unwrapPrivateKey` → `reconstructKey` | **Rides the §3.3 unwrap path, but not named** (export is not in the `PGPPrivateOperationKind` set) | Confirm the presenter wraps `unwrapPrivateKey` for **all** callers so export is covered; otherwise migrate it explicitly. |
| **SE custody generation (self-sign)** | Detached sheet | `SecKeyCreateSignature` during the custody cert self-sign (`SystemSecureEnclaveCustodyDigestSigner`) | Custody **deferred** (Item 3) | Fold into the product-shaped custody + in-window work when custody is productized (see [POC findings](AUTH_LIFECYCLE_REDESIGN_POC_FINDINGS.md) → Deferred). |
| **Guided tutorial** | None (isolated) | tutorial uses `Mock*` SE/Keychain primitives (`Sources/Security/Mocks`) | N/A — no real prompt | No migration; note only. Revisit if the tutorial ever uses real hardware-backed processing ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) §6). |

**Not gaps:** app-session unlock and ProtectedData root-secret access already thread
`kSecUseAuthenticationContext` and are covered by the unlock presenter (§3.2) / DESIGN §7.

This inventory is recorded on the PoC branch now; it is consolidated into the durable `main` docs
when the branch is closed out.
